The Macmillan template consists of a series of Word template files, some of which contain a variety of VBA macros and some of which contain the Macmillan style sets, for use in working with manuscripts. When installed on a PC (Office 2007 - 2013), the user gets a custom tab on the ribbon from which to launch the macros; when installed on a Mac (Office 2011), the user gets a custom floating toolbar.

The code modules are available from [our Github repository](https://github.com/macmillanpublishers/Word-template).

We haven't tested it on Office 2016 yet, but we're working on it!

Please see the documents [here](/docs/dev) for info about installation, development workflow, etc.

[Lynda.com has a good intro to VBA if you're interested](http://www.lynda.com/Excel-tutorials/Up-Running-VBA-Excel/62906-2.html) (it's for Excel but the same principles apply to Word).

Microsoft provides a [decent VBA reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/gg264383.aspx) as well.

Documentation for *using* the Macmillan template (and styles more generally) is available [here](https://confluence.macmillan.com/display/PBL/Manuscript+Styling+with+MS+Word).
