# vba_utilities
Reusable modules and dev utilities for the Macmillan Word template and macros.


## Utilities
A series of modules containing classes and functions required for other Macmillan VBA projects, notably [Word-template](https://github.com/macmillanpublishers/Word-template). Just save the `MacroUtilities.dotm` file in the same directory as your primary template, be sure it is loaded as an add-in, and you can call procedures in the format `Project.Module.Procedure`.

## Dev Tools
A series of macros to help with VBA development.
